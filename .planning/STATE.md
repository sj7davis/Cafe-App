## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v1.0 complete: app is standalone, deployable to Railway
- v1.1: email via Resend (RESEND_API_KEY), QR codes via `qrcode` npm package
- Staff order polling every 20s (WebSocket deferred — overkill for MVP)
- Menu images via URL input first; S3/Cloudflare R2 deferred to v1.2+
- DB schema already has tables for all v1.1 features — no new migrations expected for schema shape, only logic
